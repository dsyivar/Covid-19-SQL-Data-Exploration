In this SQL script, I performed a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, starting with the selection of key columns such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population from the dbo.CovidDeaths table. I calculated the death percentage for each location using a formula that prevents division by zero, providing insights into the mortality impact of COVID-19. I then analyzed the percentage of the population infected in various regions, identifying countries with the highest infection rates and those with the highest death counts relative to their populations. To further enhance the analysis, I explored vaccination data from the dbo.CovidVaccinations table, calculating the total number of vaccinated individuals using a rolling sum function. I determined the vaccination percentage by dividing the number of vaccinated people by the population. For a clearer structure, I used a Common Table Expression (CTE) named PopVsVac and created a temporary table #PopulationVaccinatedPercent to store calculated results for later use. Finally, I created a view named PopulationVaccinatedPercent to simplify future data retrieval, making this analysis both efficient and easily reusable.
